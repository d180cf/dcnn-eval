The idea is to build a DCNN that would answer one question:
is the group safe? More precisely, it will tell whether
the group cannot be captured if the opponent starts
and can recapture any ko. If the group is safe, the player
can tenuki. If it's not safe, a move is needed to protect it.

# Features

The input to the DCNN will be a list of planes with features
or in other terms in will be a tensor of shape `[F, N, N]`
where `F` is the number of features and `N x N` is the area
that these features are computed for. Each `N x N` frame is
a matrix composed of `0`s and `1`s only.

The features are:

- If the location is outside the board.
- If the stone is black.
- If the stone is white.
- If stone belongs to the target block.
- If the stone is in atari, i.e. it has only 1 liberty.
- If the stone has adjcent stones of the same color.

More features to be implemented:

- If the stone can be captured in a ladder (aka the lambda-1 sequence).
- If the stone can be captured with a net (aka the lambda-2 sequence).
- If this location is the center of a nakade shape.
- If the stone is surely alive, i.e. belongs to the outer wall or to an alive shape.
- Some sort of eye-detection, heuristics and so on.

# DCNN

Then this set of feature tensors is fed to a Python script that
uses TensorFlow to find the DCNN parameters.

Once the DCNN parameters are found, it can be used in the tsumego
solver to evaluate the board and refine the search.

For now the DCNN design is simple and is taken from the ["MNIST for Experts"](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros) TensorFlow tutorial:

1. The input is a set of `[11, 11, 5]` tensors where `11 x 11` is an area on the board with the target stone in the center and `5` is the number of features described above.
2. The 1-st layer transofrms this tensor into a let's say `[5, 5, 10]` one with a convolution and max pooling. The area is shirnked to `5 x 5`, but the number of features is doubled.
3. The 2-nd layer does the same and makes a `[2, 2, 20]` tensor.
4. Densely-connected layer transforms the `[2, 2, 20]` tensor into a `[256]` vector.
5. Dropout to reduce overfitting.
6. Readout to transform the `[256]` vector into a value in the `0..1` range: the prediction whether the target group is safe.

# How inputs to DCNN are generated

1. There is a set of 100 or so tsumegos with proper outer wall and marked target.
2. Each tsumego is solved and a tree of subproblems is generated. There is usually about 5000 subproblems per each problem.
3. Features are computed for each of the subproblem for the entire board. This step takes a while, so the set of subproblems is zipped and saved in a npm package.
4. From each tensor with features a script takes `N x N` areas around a stone in the target block. Since a target block usually has 4-5 stones, this multiplies the number of feature tensors by 4-5. Features are computed quickly.
5. There are 8 symmetries generated by rotation and transposition.
6. Finally the set of ~20M feature tensors with labels is converted to a TensorFlow format and saved as a python package.
